create a boss which only really works in FPS where you have to shoot targets and missed targets mean you get hit

starting people can have different strategies:
- double hearts but deal double damage ( for hearts synergy builds)
- double keys and bombs but deal less damage ( for bombs synergy builds)
- double damage but half pickups ( for damage synergy builds)

touching an enemy should also damadge the enemy not just yourself

should enemies and dangerous enviroments be rng based? or should it be a mix of rng and premade rooms?

How should floor and room generation work? it should follow rules for the user to find out

I want to utilise walls being destroyable with secret rooms and hidden items in the walls ( but it cant just be obvious ) so maybe tinted walls. 

I think also the floor should have some rocks  ( half walls ) to make it look like a maze and some should be explodable, some should have tints, some should hide enemies ( rock enemies ) ( with a very subtle indicator to say its a rock enemy)

I think some rooms should have no floor to them and so the user can fall into a pit. falling looses health
