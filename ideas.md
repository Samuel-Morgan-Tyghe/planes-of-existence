create a boss which only really works in FPS where you have to shoot targets and missed targets mean you get hit

starting people can have different strategies:
- double hearts but deal double damage ( for hearts synergy builds)
- double keys and bombs but deal less damage ( for bombs synergy builds)
- double damage but half pickups ( for damage synergy builds)

touching an enemy should also damadge the enemy not just yourself

should enemies and dangerous enviroments be rng based? or should it be a mix of rng and premade rooms?

How should floor and room generation work? it should follow rules for the user to find out

I want to utilise walls being destroyable with secret rooms and hidden items in the walls ( but it cant just be obvious ) so maybe tinted walls. 

I think also the floor should have some rocks  ( half walls ) to make it look like a maze and some should be explodable, some should have tints, some should hide enemies ( rock enemies ) ( with a very subtle indicator to say its a rock enemy)

I think some rooms should have no floor to them and so the user can fall into a pit. falling looses health 

we need to add knockback as a stat and add items 

projectile size should often be linked to projectile damage

We can encorporate AI as part of the initial run generation, Image generation of assets based on some factor from the user. I like the idea of the user being able to input into a form and then we use those keywords to generate assets for the run.  
I think we have to glitch all the assets aswell to make this work. I like the idea of names also could be affected. 


bosses should spawn an item.

player shouldnt get same item twice

player shouldnt be able to double jump

on entering a door left or right and holding the same button it goes for a little bit then maximum reverse. jumping helps keep the correct direction.

shops should have symbol on minimap

decals arent showing up correctly. 

bombs and projectiles should leave thier mark
